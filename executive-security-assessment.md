# Executive Security Risk Assessment (Simulated)

## Executive Summary
This assessment evaluates key security risks that could impact an enterprise
from both technical and business perspectives.
The goal is to identify critical weaknesses and prioritize mitigation strategies
aligned with business objectives.

## Risk Overview
The assessment focuses on common enterprise threat scenarios,
including identity compromise, privilege misuse, and insufficient monitoring.

## Top Identified Risks

### 1. Weak Identity and Access Management
Inadequate password policies and excessive permissions increase the risk
of account compromise and unauthorized access.

### 2. Lack of Privilege Segmentation
Overprivileged accounts allow attackers to escalate access rapidly
once an initial foothold is obtained.

### 3. Limited Security Visibility
Insufficient logging and monitoring reduce the organization’s ability
to detect suspicious activities in a timely manner.

### 4. Inadequate Incident Response Readiness
Delayed response procedures can amplify the impact of security incidents.

### 5. Security Awareness Gaps
Users remain a primary attack vector due to phishing and social engineering.

## Business Impact
If exploited, these risks could result in:
- Operational disruption
- Data exposure
- Regulatory penalties
- Reputational damage

## Recommendations
- Enforce strong identity and access management controls
- Implement least privilege principles
- Enhance security monitoring and detection capabilities
- Regularly test incident response plans
- Strengthen security awareness programs

## Conclusion
Addressing these risks proactively improves organizational resilience
and reduces the likelihood of high-impact security incidents.
